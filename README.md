# EDA
Welcome to the EDA with Pokémon Dataset workshop! This repository is designed to guide participants through an in-depth exploration of a popular dataset using Python.

## Workshop Overview
In this workshop, we’ll use Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the Pokémon dataset. The dataset consists of stats and attributes for 800+ Pokémon, including columns for Name, Type, HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Generation, and Legendary Status. I got this data from a public github repository!
